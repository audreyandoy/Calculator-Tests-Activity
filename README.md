Create a Calculator

We will build a calculator that can do the following operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide

For each operation you will:
- Create a function dedicated to that operation in `calculator.py`
- Create tests for that function:
    - Write 2 nominal cases
    - Write 3 edge cases
